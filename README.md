# DAFT template

DAFT is a minimal set of principles to make research papers more reproducible.
This repository contains a template showing how to organize your manuscript files according to the **DAFT principles**:

- Use DAFT-numbered directories (structure)
- Follow a self-contained data flow (workflow)
- Add one README per subdirectory (documentation)

## Directories

- [`0-data`](0-data): Raw data and datasets associated with the study.
- [`1-analyses`](1-analyses): Script files and outputs of individual analyses.
- [`2-figures`](2-figures): Source files for figure plates.
- [`3-text`](3-text): Source files for the manuscript text.
